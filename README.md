# WorkoutFormatter
Object-Oriented program that reformats my notes on my workouts in a more digestible way as the record of workouts scales larger. 

As a novice weightlifter, I began to track my workouts on my phone's notes app. However, as my workouts grew more complicated and the note grew larger, managing all the information became inconvenient. As such, I wrote this program to format my workouts in a way that is future-proof. I'll run it from time-to-time to make inputting future workouts more simple.

I employed the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, including encapsulation and polymorphism. I made use of the Java Standard Library, drawing from the Stack, ArrayList, Scanner, and File classes. I also created two custom classes, WorkoutFormatter and WorkoutBlock, to encapsulate some of the data management and facilitate the process.
